**STORY PREMISE:**

Mayuri encounters Chitti, a young sparrow who has developed a habit of begging for food from other forest creatures instead of gathering it herself. Chitti waits by gathering areas asking for handouts, claiming she's "too small" or "too tired" to work. Mayuri, remembering her own lessons about perseverance and self-reliance, decides to teach Chitti the dignity of earning through honest effort. Through a berry-gathering challenge and patient mentorship, Mayuri shows Chitti that the pride of earning is far greater than the ease of receiving handouts. Guru the owl observes approvingly as Mayuri becomes the teacher.

🦚 ஏற்பது இகழ்ச்சி | To Accept Alms is Shameful | Mayuri's Aathichudi Lessons Ep. 7
```

**Description**:
```
Join Mayuri the peacock as she teaches an important life lesson from Aathichudi: "ஏற்பது இகழ்ச்சி" (To accept alms is shameful - earn through honest work)!

When Mayuri encounters Chitti, a young sparrow who has developed the habit of begging for food instead of gathering it herself, Mayuri decides to teach her the dignity of earning through honest effort. Through patient mentorship and a berry-gathering challenge, Mayuri shows Chitti that the pride of earning is far greater than the ease of receiving handouts. With Guru the wise owl observing, Mayuri becomes the teacher, passing on the wisdom she once learned.

🎯 Moral: To accept alms is shameful. Maintain dignity through self-reliance and earn through your own honest work.
