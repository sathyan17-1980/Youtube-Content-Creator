### Step 3: Generate Scene Images (Leonardo.ai)
1. Use Max & Momo character references for consistency
2. Generate Scene 1-11 images using prompts above

4. Verify progression: Scenes 1-2 (tropical village), Scenes 3-6 (jungle/bell tree), Scenes 7-11 (village transformation with snow)
5. Ensure vibrant colors and magical atmosphere throughout all scenes

### Step 4: Animate Scenes (MiniMax Hailuo)
1. Upload each scene image (11 total)

## Key Differentiators from Original "Ring the Magic Bells"

This production improves on the original with:

✅ **Character-driven story** (Max & Momo duo - boy & monkey vs. solo Jingle bell)
✅ **More relatable characters** (adventurous boy + playful monkey = classic duo kids love!)
✅ **FASTER tempo** (180-200 BPM vs. 120-140 BPM) - true Carol of the Bells energy
✅ **Unique visual setting** (tropical village transforming to snowy wonderland)
✅ **Stronger emotional arc** (wish → discovery → kindness → magical reward)
✅ **Teamwork theme** (boy & monkey working together, complementary skills)
✅ **Visual variety** (warm tropics → mixed → winter wonderland vs. all winter)
✅ **Higher energy throughout** (no gentle moments, constant excitement)
✅ **Clearer message** ("Friendship creates magic" + "Wishes come true through action")
✅ **More dynamic movement** (boyish energy + monkey agility vs. static bell character)
