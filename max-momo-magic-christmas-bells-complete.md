- Final magical shimmer (bells)

Pacing:
- MAXIMUM INTENSITY (0-26s) - rapid movements, quick cuts, explosive energy
- GENTLE TRANSITION (26-34s) - slow motion hug, graceful camera pullback, peaceful fade

This is the GRAND FINALE - hold nothing back, then end with peaceful wonder.

## Voice Direction & Audio Notes

### Voice Style for HIGH-ENERGY Song

**CRITICAL:** This is a FAST, high-energy song (180-200 BPM), not gentle!

- **Lead vocals**: HIGH-pitched children's choir (12-20 kids ages 7-14)
- **Energy**: MAXIMUM - bright, crystalline, urgent, excited
- **Pitch**: HIGH register throughout (think Carol of the Bells soprano lines)
- **Tempo**: FAST (180-200 BPM) - rapid, clear enunciation at speed
- **Solo moments**: Brief featured child voice (energetic, powerful) for verse lines
- **Chorus**: FULL choir with tight harmonies, layered voices
- **Background**: Rhythmic "oh" and "ah" punctuations, not gentle sustains
- **Emotion**: THRILLING, exhilarating, joyful urgency throughout
- **Pacing**: NO slow moments - maintain intensity from start to finish
- **Breathing**: Quick breaths, sustained energy, no gentle fade-outs (except final outro)

### Audio Production Notes

- **Background music**: Generated from Suno with specifications above (fast tempo, high energy)
- **Bell sounds**: CONSTANT throughout (not occasional) - jingle bells, hand bells, chimes creating rhythmic foundation
- **Sound effects to add**:
  - Rapid bell cascades (intro, transitions)
  - Magical sparkle "burst" sounds (fast, percussive)
  - Snowfall "shimmer" (subtle, constant once snow appears)
  - Star burst "explosion" (Scene 4 & 5 - dramatic)
  - Firework "pops" (Scene 5 - rapid succession)
  - Aurora "shimmer" (Scene 5 - ethereal)
  - Final bell chime (outro - single, clear, fading)

2. Generate 2-3 variations
3. Select version with FASTEST tempo, HIGHEST energy, clearest vocals
4. Verify duration is ~3:30
5. **CRITICAL**: Ensure tempo is 180-200 BPM, NOT slower!

### Step 3: Generate Scene Images (Leonardo.ai)
1. Use Max & Momo character references for consistency
2. Generate Scene 1-5 images using prompts above
3. 9:16 vertical aspect ratio for all
4. Verify tropical setting in Scenes 1-2, snow appearing Scene 3, full snow Scenes 4-5
5. Ensure vibrant colors and magical atmosphere

### Step 4: Animate Scenes (MiniMax Hailuo)
1. Upload each scene image
2. Paste animation prompts (ensure MINIMUM duration specified)
3. Generate 25-35 second animations
4. **CRITICAL**: Verify animations match FAST tempo (rapid movements, no slow moments)
5. Check that magic effects are dramatic and visible

### Step 5: Add Captions (Video editor - FFmpeg/DaVinci Resolve/Shotstack)

6. Add captions with precise timing
7. Color grade for vibrancy (boost saturation on tropical elements, enhance snow whites)
8. Export 9:16 vertical MP4, 1080x1920 resolution minimum
9. **FINAL CHECK**: Watch at full speed - does energy match song tempo?

## Key Differentiators from Original "Ring the Magic Bells"

This production improves on the original with:

✅ **Character-driven story** (Max & Momo duo - boy & monkey vs. solo Jingle bell)
✅ **More relatable characters** (adventurous boy + playful monkey = classic duo kids love!)
✅ **FASTER tempo** (180-200 BPM vs. 120-140 BPM) - true Carol of the Bells energy
✅ **Unique visual setting** (tropical village transforming to snowy wonderland)
✅ **Stronger emotional arc** (wish → discovery → kindness → magical reward)
✅ **Teamwork theme** (boy & monkey working together, complementary skills)
✅ **Visual variety** (warm tropics → mixed → winter wonderland vs. all winter)
✅ **Higher energy throughout** (no gentle moments, constant excitement)
✅ **Clearer message** ("Friendship creates magic" + "Wishes come true through action")
✅ **More dynamic movement** (boyish energy + monkey agility vs. static bell character)
