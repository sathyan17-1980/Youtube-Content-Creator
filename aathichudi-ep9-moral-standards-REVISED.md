MINIMUM 26 seconds duration. Mayuri continues attempting alone, fatigue showing. Reaches for paint colors but they're spread too far apart - drops brush trying to grab them. Picks up brush, spilled paint pools on ground. Frustrated wipe, continues. Tries to lift heavy decorated piece to attach to arch. Strains with effort, wings shaking, can barely lift it. Struggles to position while holding - too heavy, too awkward alone. Lowers it carefully before dropping, sits heavily with exhaustion. Breathing visibly hard, feathers drooped and messy with paint and sawdust. Looks around at her workspace - nothing completed, everything scattered, chaos of solo effort. Face shows pain of isolation now, not just difficulty but loneliness. Looks up at teams. Teams are celebrating small completions together - high-fiving, admiring each other's work, laughing. One team lifts something heavy easily with three animals working together that's similar to what she can't lift alone. Mayuri watches with expression shifting - frustration, envy, sadness, slowly dawning realization. Working alone is much much harder. Her pride is struggling with painful reality.

Words tumble out making excuses - gestures at scattered work, tries to explain. Guru watches patiently, slight gentle smile, not judging just understanding. Mayuri's excuses slow, falter, stop. Guru's silence is wiser than words. He looks slowly from Mayuri to teams working together in distance. Wing gestures gently toward them - see their smooth cooperation. Looks back at Mayuri's mess. Wing gestures at scattered chaos. Doesn't say "see the difference" - the contrast speaks itself. Looks at Mayuri with gentle question in eyes - do you see? Mayuri follows his gaze to teams, back to her mess. Face shows realization deepening - comparison is undeniable. Teams: progress, joy, ease. Her: chaos, fatigue, isolation. Expression shifts - embarrassment to understanding, resistance cracking. Looks at Guru with vulnerable confusion - how do I change this? Guru nods with encouragement, not pushing just waiting. Camera: Guru's gentle arrival, Mayuri's embarrassed response, patient observation, contrast gestures (teams/mess), close-up on realization dawning, close-up on Guru's gentle encouragement. Movement: quiet observation, gentle gestures, resistance cracking, understanding deepening. Pacing: slow wisdom, patient teaching, realization building.

## **SCENE 7: Guru's Teaching - Oppura Vozhugu** (26-29 seconds)

### Visual Description
Guru explains "ஒப்புர வொழுகு" with gentle wisdom. Uses visual examples: shows how water flows harmoniously around rocks, how trees grow together stronger than alone, how birds fly in formation reducing effort for all. Explains that working in harmony with others isn't weakness - it's wisdom. Each person's strength complements others' weaknesses. Cooperation creates balance - ஒப்புரவு. Mayuri listens intently, understanding growing, seeing cooperation as strength not weakness.

**Mood**: Teaching wisdom, enlightenment, cooperation as strength, understanding deepening
**Camera**: Close-up on Guru teaching, visual metaphors, Mayuri's enlightened expressions, understanding growing
**Lighting**: Warm wisdom light, enlightenment quality, positive teaching atmosphere
**Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 LANDSCAPE

### Animation Prompt (MiniMax Hailuo)

```
MINIMUM 28 seconds duration. Guru settles into teaching posture. Begins explaining "ஒப்புர வொழுகு" with measured wise tone. As he speaks, gentle visual metaphors appear illustrated by camera and light. First metaphor: nearby stream shown - water flows smoothly around rocks, not fighting them, working with the landscape harmoniously. Guru gestures - see how harmony with surroundings makes flow easier. Second metaphor: camera shows cluster of trees growing together - roots intertwined, supporting each other, standing stronger together than single tree. Guru's wing traces their connection - strength in unity. Third metaphor: birds fly overhead in V-formation. Guru points up - each bird makes flight easier for others, taking turns at front, cooperation reduces everyone's effort. Returns focus to Mayuri. Guru explains: working with others isn't weakness, it's wisdom. Each person has strengths and weaknesses. Alone: weaknesses limit you. Together: your strength helps another's weakness, their strength helps yours. Creates balance - ஒப்புரவு. Cooperation is foundation of community - ஒத்துழைபு. Mayuri listens with complete attention. Expression shifts through understanding - eyes widening, nodding slowly as concepts connect. Looks at teams with new eyes - not just working together but creating balance, strength, harmony. Looks back at her solo chaos - now sees isolation as limitation, not independence. Understanding fully dawns - cooperation is strength. Camera: Guru teaching close-up, visual metaphor sequences (water, trees, birds), teaching gestures, Mayuri's growing understanding, new perspective on teams, realization complete. Movement: wisdom teaching, gentle metaphors, understanding building to enlightenment. Pacing: measured teaching, concepts settling, enlightenment achieving.
