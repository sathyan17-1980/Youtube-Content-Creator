**STORY PREMISE:**

Mayuri finds a cluster of delicious mangoes and is about to eat them all herself when Guru appears. Instead of lecturing, Guru invites Mayuri to observe a family of crows. They watch as Kaka (father crow) finds food and, before eating, calls his family to share. The parents feed their young ones first, then share with an elderly crow who struggles to find food. Through this observation, Mayuri learns that true satisfaction comes not from eating alone, but from ensuring others are fed first. She realizes the beauty of "ஐயமிட்டு உண்" - sharing food before eating.

Join Mayuri the peacock as she learns a beautiful life lesson from Aathichudi: "ஐயமிட்டு உண்" (Share food before eating - show compassion and generosity)!
