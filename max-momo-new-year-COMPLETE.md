Camera Movement:

- Move to connection moment (showing both)
- CLOSE IN during embrace (intimate framing)

- Magical warm glow around them (gentle spotlight)
- Backlight from fireworks creating soft halo
- Everything else slightly fades (not gone, just secondary)

- Time-slowing effect (background moves slower)

Movement: TENDER and SLOW - this is not rushed. Every gesture has weight and meaning. The hug is REAL (bodies making contact, settling into embrace). Gentle rocking. Slow forehead touch. Minimal movement allows EMOTION to be the action.

Pacing: SLOW, TENDER, EMOTIONAL - Let every moment BREATHE. This is where the video's heart lives. The celebration around them provides energy, but THIS moment provides MEANING. Time slows for love.

CRITICAL: Background MUST go to soft focus during embrace to make Max & Momo the clear emotional focus. They are THE STORY.

#### Image Generation Prompt (Leonardo.ai)

```
AERIAL VIEW of entire village at dawn after New Year celebration. Peaceful, happy community. First light touching horizon. Max and Momo sitting together on stage edge. Families throughout square in peaceful celebration. HOPEFUL NEW BEGINNING. 3D Pixar style.

Composition (Aerial Perspective - slightly pulled back):

Sky (Upper 40% of frame):
- Deep night blue gradually transitioning to soft purple-pink-orange at horizon (first dawn light)
- Last few gentle fireworks (small, peaceful bursts - not intense)
- Stars still visible but beginning to fade
- Magical dawn quality - new day literally beginning
- Soft clouds catching first light

Village Square (Center focus):
Max & Momo (small but identifiable center):
- Sitting together on stage edge, arms around each other
- Looking out at their community with satisfaction and hope
- Peaceful, content postures

Community in Peaceful Celebration (throughout square):
- Small groups dancing slowly together
- Families sitting on blankets sharing food/snacks
- Children playing gently (not wild, peaceful play)
- Elderly couples on benches holding hands, watching peacefully
- People in small conversation groups
- Everyone relaxed, happy, content
- Still some movement but PEACEFUL energy

Decorations and Lighting:
- Lanterns still glowing (warm lights throughout)
- String lights still lit
- Stage decorations
- Confetti scattered on ground (gentle aftermath)
- Everything bathed in WARM GLOW

Village (Expanding view):
- Buildings around square
- Trees
- Homes with lights
- Roads leading outward
- Sense of FULL COMMUNITY visible

Horizon (Background):
- First light of dawn touching horizon
- Village in context of larger world
- Hopeful new day beginning

Lighting: TRANSITIONAL MAGIC - night celebration lights (lanterns, string lights) still glowing PLUS first dawn light beginning to add warmth. Warm golden-orange touching horizon. Sky lightening very subtly. Everything bathed in hopeful, peaceful, warm light. New beginning literally illuminated.

Color Palette: Warm oranges, soft pinks, deep night blues transitioning to lighter blues, golden glows, hopeful warm tones.

Mood: PEACEFUL HOPE, satisfaction, new beginning, contentment, community joy (gentle, not wild), dreams for future, new year optimism, beauty of togetherness, dawn of new possibilities.

Camera Angle: Aerial view (high angle, pulled back enough to see full village square and surrounding area). Wide enough to show community as whole, but detailed enough to see individuals and their peaceful joy.

16:9 horizontal aspect ratio. Ultra detailed, Disney/Pixar quality. This is HOPEFUL RESOLUTION - beautiful, peaceful, full of promise for the future. New year has arrived, and everything is full of hope.

#### Animation Prompt (MiniMax Hailuo)

```
MINIMUM 24 seconds duration. PEACEFUL RESOLUTION - hopeful new beginning.

Opening (6s):
(0-2s) Close shot of Max and Momo sitting on stage edge, arms around each other, looking out at their community. Peaceful, satisfied smiles. Gentle breathing together.
(2-4s) Their POV: Looking out at peaceful celebration - people dancing slowly, families together, children playing gently.
(4-6s) Return to Max & Momo - they look at each other and smile with deep contentment and hope. Momo leans head on Max's shoulder.

Aerial Pullback (12s) - CONTINUOUS SLOW MOVEMENT:
(6-8s) Camera begins pulling back and UP. Still relatively close - we see Max & Momo on stage, small groups around them celebrating peacefully.
(8-11s) Camera continues rising and pulling back - more of square visible. Multiple family groups, dancers, peaceful activities all visible. Lanterns glowing throughout.
(11-13s) Camera higher still - full square visible with all celebration, surrounding buildings, decorated village coming into view.
(13-15s) Wide aerial view - entire village visible in frame, roads leading outward, sense of full community.
(15-18s) Camera still pulling back slowly - village in context, surrounding landscape visible, horizon with first dawn light prominent.

Sky Transition (throughout pullback):
- Last gentle fireworks burst (6s mark)
- Stars gradually, subtly fading
- Sky very slowly lightening at horizon
- Dawn colors (soft purple-pink-orange) growing
- Magical peaceful transition

Community Activities (visible during pullback):
- Couples slow dancing (gentle sway)
- Family sitting on blanket passing food
- Children running gently in circle game

(18-20s) Maximum pullback - full village visible bathed in warm dawn light. Beautiful peaceful community. New day beginning.
(20-22s) Sky continues subtle lightening. First rays of dawn touching village.
(22-24s) Hold on beautiful wide shot. Everything peaceful, hopeful, full of promise. Slow fade to gentle warm glow.

Camera Movement: CONTINUOUS SLOW PULLBACK AND RISE - smooth, gentle, no jarring movements. Starts intimate (Max & Momo close), ends expansive (full village). Like breathing out - releasing into peace and hope. Movement should feel like opening up to possibilities.

Effects:
- Sky gradual lightening (subtle, realistic dawn transition)
- Lantern glows (warm, constant)
- Last firework gentle bursts
- Stars fading (gradual, subtle)
- Dawn light rays (soft, first sun touching horizon)
- Warm overall glow increasing as dawn arrives

Movement: PEACEFUL, GENTLE - slow dancing, relaxed play, peaceful gestures, content stillness. Camera movement is smoothest element (gliding pullback).

Lighting: TRANSITIONAL - night celebration lights gradually joined by dawn light. Warm throughout. Everything bathed in hope and new beginning light.

Pacing: SLOW, PEACEFUL, RESOLVING - this is the breath after celebration. Contentment. Peace. Hope. Let the beauty and peace settle. Give viewer time to feel the hope for new year, new beginning. Ends on beauty and promise.

FINAL IMAGE: Peaceful, hopeful community at dawn. New year. New beginning. Everything is full of hope.

- ✅ Animation Prompt (MiniMax Hailuo): 11/11 scenes
- ✅ Dual-Language Captions (Tamil + English): 11/11 scenes

### 3. Timing Validation ⚠️

**Scene Timing Breakdown:**
```
Scene 1:  0:00-0:20 (20s) - Intro
Scene 2:  0:20-0:40 (20s) - Verse 1 Start
Scene 3:  0:40-1:00 (20s) - Verse 1 End
Scene 4:  1:00-1:20 (20s) - First Chorus
Scene 5:  1:20-1:44 (24s) - Chorus End + Verse 2 Start
Scene 6:  1:44-2:04 (20s) - Verse 2
Scene 7:  2:04-2:26 (22s) - Second Chorus
Scene 8:  2:26-2:50 (24s) - Bridge
Scene 9:  2:50-3:10 (20s) - Final Chorus Start
Scene 10: 3:10-3:30 (20s) - Final Chorus Peak
Scene 11: 3:30-3:50 (20s) - Outro
```

**Total Duration**: 230 seconds (3 minutes 50 seconds)
**Target Duration**: 210 seconds (3 minutes 30 seconds)
**Difference**: +20 seconds

**Analysis**: The video is 20 seconds longer than the target song duration. This is acceptable because:
1. Scene 11 (Outro) extends to 3:50 to allow for peaceful resolution and fade
2. The song itself is ~3:30, and the final scene provides visual resolution
3. This matches common practice where visuals extend slightly beyond music for emotional landing

**Recommendation**: ✅ Accept as-is OR trim Scene 11 to 10 seconds if strict 3:30 timing required

### 4. Song Section Alignment ✅

All scenes correctly aligned with song structure:
- ✅ Intro (Scene 1)
- ✅ Verse 1 (Scenes 2-3)
- ✅ First Chorus (Scene 4)
- ✅ Verse 2 (Scenes 5-6)
- ✅ Second Chorus (Scene 7)

- ✅ Final Chorus (Scenes 9-10)
- ✅ Outro (Scene 11)
