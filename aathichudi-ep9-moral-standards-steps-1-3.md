Mayuri visits the forest marketplace and witnesses Ravi the Fox, a popular merchant, treating Chintu the Mouse unfairly because of his small size and poverty. When Ravi cheats Chintu on a trade, Mayuri must decide whether to speak up (risking her reputation) or stay silent (maintaining popularity). She chooses to stand up for what's right, facing ridicule from other animals. When Ravi's dishonesty is later exposed through a larger scheme, the community realizes Mayuri's moral courage.

### Animation Prompt (MiniMax Hailuo)

```
MINIMUM 28 seconds duration. Ravi recovers quickly from being challenged. Turns to crowd with practiced charm returning. Gestures dismissively at Mayuri, speaking to crowd conspiratorially. Crowd begins nodding, persuaded. Priya steps forward, shaking head at Mayuri disapprovingly. Other animals begin whispering, pointing at Mayuri. Some turn their backs deliberately. Judgmental looks multiply. Mayuri stands alone now, crowd pulling away from her creating space around her. Her confident posture wavers - shoulders drop slightly, wings pull in closer to body. Hurt shows in eyes but jaw remains set - not backing down despite pain. Looks around at former friendly faces now judging her. Priya turns away completely. More animals whisper. Ravi adds tiny bit more grain to Chintu's pile with exaggerated generosity gesture toward crowd, as if proving Mayuri was being petty. Waves Mayuri away dismissively. Crowd murmurs approval at Ravi's "generosity." Chintu watches Mayuri with sad grateful eyes, powerless to help her, knows grain is still unfair. Mayuri stands isolated but doesn't leave. Camera: Ravi's manipulation shots, crowd turning shots, close-ups on judgmental faces, close-up on Mayuri's hurt but resolved face, isolation wide shot, Ravi's smug dismissal, Chintu's sadness. Movement: crowd pulling away, Mayuri's physical isolation, Ravi's performance, social rejection dynamics. Pacing: building pressure, manipulation, isolation, testing courage.
