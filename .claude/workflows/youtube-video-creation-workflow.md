# YouTube Kids Video Creation Workflow

## Overview
Complete workflow for creating production-ready YouTube videos for 2-4 year olds using AI tools.

---

## Input Requirements
- **Idea**: Story concept, moral, or theme (can be in Tamil or English)
- **Optional**: Reference image for character continuity in series

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### **STEP 1: Idea Analysis & Copyright Check**

**Objective**: Determine if the idea works better as SONG or DRAMA, and verify no copyright issues.

**Input**: User provides idea (e.g., "உடையது விளம்பேல்" - Don't be a blowhard)

**LLM Analysis** (Claude Sonnet 4.5 recommended):

1. **Song vs Drama Evaluation**:
   - **For Drama**: Evaluate if moral/story has clear character arc, cause-effect relationship, emotional journey
   - **For Song**: Evaluate if moral can be conveyed in simple, repetitive lyrics with catchy melody
   - **Recommendation**: Provide reasoning for both with pros/cons
   - **Age appropriateness**: Confirm suitable for 2-4 yr olds

2. **Copyright Check**:
   - Verify if idea is based on public domain content (proverbs, traditional stories)
   - Check for conflicts with existing copyrighted characters/stories
   - Confirm original elements are unique
   - Declare: CLEAR or POTENTIAL ISSUES (with details)

**Output**:
- Recommendation: Song OR Drama (with reasoning)
- Copyright Status: CLEAR or flagged issues
- **User Decision Required**: User chooses final format

---

### **STEP 2: Content Generation Based on Format**

#### **IF DRAMA:**

##### **2a. Image Prompts (6-8 scenes)**
- Generate detailed image prompts for each scene
- Requirements:
  - **Character consistency**: Same appearance, clothing, personality across all scenes
  - **3D Pixar style**: Vibrant colors, expressive faces, soft lighting
  - **Camera angles**: Specify for each scene (low angle, close-up, wide shot, etc.)
  - **Setting details**: Environment, props, background elements
  - **Mood/Lighting**: Time of day, emotional tone, lighting style
  - **Cultural elements**: If Tamil/Indian content, include appropriate cultural details

##### **2b. Animation Direction (per scene)**
- **Camera movement**: Pan, zoom, dolly, static
- **Character animation**: What actions/movements occur
- **Duration**: How long each scene should be (typically 15-30 seconds)
- **Transition to next scene**: Fade, cut, dissolve, wipe

##### **2c. Dialogue Generation (Tamil + English)**
- Generate dialogue for each scene in BOTH languages
- Requirements:
  - **Age-appropriate**: Simple vocabulary for 2-4 yr olds
  - **Natural flow**: Conversational, not preachy
  - **Emotional tone**: Match scene mood (excited, sad, thoughtful)
  - **Length**: Keep dialogue short (1-2 sentences per scene max)
  - **Tamil quality**: User will rewrite Tamil for authenticity

##### **2d. Voice Direction**
- **Character voices**: Specify voice type (child, elderly, energetic, calm)
- **Emotion tags**: Happy, sad, excited, whispering, dramatic
- **Pacing**: Fast, normal, slow
- **Audio sync notes**: Where dialogue aligns with visuals

---

#### **IF SONG:**

##### **2a. Lyrics (Tamil + English)**
- Simple, repetitive structure
- Rhyming scheme for memorability
- Chorus that reinforces moral
- Age-appropriate vocabulary

##### **2b. Music Prompt (for Suno)**
- Genre: Kids music, nursery rhyme, playful, educational
- Tempo: Upbeat, moderate, slow
- Instruments: Describe desired sound (acoustic, playful piano, gentle guitar)
- Mood: Cheerful, calming, energetic

##### **2c. Image Prompts (3-5 scenes)**
- Simpler than drama (fewer scenes)
- Focus on visual representation of lyrics
- Repetitive visual motifs for chorus

##### **2d. Animation Direction**
- Sync with music beats
- Visual accents on key lyrics
- Looping animations for repetitive parts

---

### **STEP 3: Video Production Flow**

#### **3a. Scene-by-Scene Video Assembly**

For each scene, provide:

1. **Image Generation Prompt**: Paste into Leonardo.ai
   - Use Character Reference feature (upload reference image if series)
   - Set to 9:16 aspect ratio (576×1024 or 768×1344)
   - Generate 2-3 variations per scene

2. **Animation Prompt**: Paste into image-to-video tool
   - **Tool**: MiniMax Hailuo (recommended for kids content, $0.08/sec)
   - **Alternative**: Runway Gen-3 Turbo, Luma Dream Machine
   - **Camera movement**: Specify pan, zoom, dolly, static
   - **Character action**: What the character does
   - **Duration**: 10-30 seconds per scene
   - **Director controls**: "pan down", "dolly zoom", "slow zoom in"

3. **Transition to Next Scene**:
   - Type: Cut, fade, dissolve, wipe
   - Duration: 0.5-1 second
   - Color/effect: Match mood shift

---

#### **3b. Continuity Elements**

**Visual Continuity**:
- Character design consistency (use same reference image)
- Lighting consistency (maintain time of day across scenes)
- Color grading (same warm/cool tone throughout)
- Prop consistency (if character holds item, maintain across scenes)

**Narrative Continuity**:
- Story flow (cause → effect → resolution)
- Character emotional arc (start → change → end)
- Location consistency (if in same place, maintain layout)

**Audio Continuity**:
- Voice consistency (same voice actor/TTS throughout)
- Background music/ambience (fade in/out, don't cut abruptly)
- Sound effects (consistent style - cartoon vs realistic)

---

#### **3c. Pacing & Timing**

**Total Video Duration**: 2-5 minutes (optimal for 2-4 yr olds)

**Scene Duration Guidelines**:
- **Opening scene**: 20-30 seconds (establish character/setting)
- **Middle scenes**: 15-25 seconds each (story progression)
- **Climax scene**: 30-40 seconds (key learning moment)
- **Resolution scene**: 20-30 seconds (moral reinforcement)

**Dialogue Pacing**:
- Pause 1-2 seconds after dialogue before next scene
- Allow time for visual action without dialogue
- Don't rush - kids need processing time

---

### **STEP 4: Audio Production**

#### **4a. Voice Generation (for Drama)**

**Tool**: ElevenLabs (English), Azure TTS (Tamil recommended)

**Per Scene**:
1. Dialogue text (from Step 2c)
2. Voice selection:
   - **Main character**: Consistent voice throughout
   - **Supporting characters**: Distinct voices
3. Emotion tags: `[excited]`, `[whispers]`, `[giggles]`, `[dramatic tone]`
4. Generate audio file for each scene

**Alternative**: Murf AI (has kids voices for English)

---

#### **4b. Music Generation (for Song)**

**Tool**: Suno (manual, no API)

1. Paste lyrics + music prompt
2. Generate 2-3 variations
3. Select best version
4. Download audio file

**For Drama Background Music**:
- Use SOUNDRAW API (instrumental only)
- Generate subtle background track
- Keep volume low (don't overpower dialogue)

---

#### **4c. Audio Sync Notes**

For each scene, specify:
- **Dialogue start time**: When voice begins (e.g., "0:02")
- **Background music**: Fade in/out points
- **Sound effects**: Where to add (door open, bird chirp, footsteps)
- **Silence**: Where to pause for visual impact

---

### **STEP 5: Video Assembly**

**Tool**: FFmpeg or Shotstack API

**Assembly Order**:
1. Import all animated scene videos (from Step 3)
2. Import all voice audio files (from Step 4)
3. Import background music (if applicable)
4. Import sound effects

**Timeline**:
```
Scene 1 (30s) → Transition (0.5s) → Scene 2 (20s) → Transition (0.5s) → ...
├─ Video: scene1.mp4
├─ Audio: dialogue_scene1.mp3 (0:02-0:08)
└─ Music: background.mp3 (volume: 20%, fade in 0-2s)
```

**Final Output**:
- Resolution: 1080×1920 (9:16 vertical for YouTube Shorts/Kids)
