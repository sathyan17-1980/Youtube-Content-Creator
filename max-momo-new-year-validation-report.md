### 3. Timing Validation ⚠️

**Scene Timing Breakdown:**
```
Scene 1:  0:00-0:20 (20s) - Intro
Scene 2:  0:20-0:40 (20s) - Verse 1 Start
Scene 3:  0:40-1:00 (20s) - Verse 1 End
Scene 4:  1:00-1:20 (20s) - First Chorus
Scene 5:  1:20-1:44 (24s) - Chorus End + Verse 2 Start
Scene 6:  1:44-2:04 (20s) - Verse 2
Scene 7:  2:04-2:26 (22s) - Second Chorus
Scene 8:  2:26-2:50 (24s) - Bridge
Scene 9:  2:50-3:10 (20s) - Final Chorus Start
Scene 10: 3:10-3:30 (20s) - Final Chorus Peak
Scene 11: 3:30-3:50 (20s) - Outro
```

**Total Duration**: 230 seconds (3 minutes 50 seconds)
**Target Duration**: 210 seconds (3 minutes 30 seconds)
**Difference**: +20 seconds

**Analysis**: The video is 20 seconds longer than the target song duration. This is acceptable because:
1. Scene 11 (Outro) extends to 3:50 to allow for peaceful resolution and fade
2. The song itself is ~3:30, and the final scene provides visual resolution
3. This matches common practice where visuals extend slightly beyond music for emotional landing

**Recommendation**: ✅ Accept as-is OR trim Scene 11 to 10 seconds if strict 3:30 timing required

### 4. Song Section Alignment ✅

All scenes correctly aligned with song structure:
- ✅ Intro (Scene 1)
