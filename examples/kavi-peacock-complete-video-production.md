## Questions to Address Continuity

**You mentioned feeling the flow doesn't come together. Let me know:**

1. **Scene order**: Does the 8-scene progression feel logical? Should any scenes be reordered?

2. **Pacing**: Are any scenes too long/short? Should we adjust durations?

3. **Transitions**: Do the transition types (dissolve, cut, fade) work for the mood shifts?

4. **Character arc**: Does Kavi's transformation feel believable? Too fast/slow?

5. **Visual flow**: Should we add establishing shots (wide views before close-ups)?

6. **Audio**: Does the dialogue-music-effects layering make sense?
