**STORY PREMISE:**

Mayuri discovers a hidden ancient library in the forest where magical books are locked behind glowing symbols (Tamil letters and numbers). Initially dismissing them as "just marks," Mayuri tries to force the books open without understanding the symbols. Vidya, the wise owl librarian, teaches Mayuri that each Tamil letter (அ, ஆ, இ...) and each number (1, 2, 3...) is a key to unlock knowledge. Through learning to read the symbols and count properly, Mayuri unlocks the library's wisdom, discovering that literacy and numeracy are powerful tools, not useless scribbles.
